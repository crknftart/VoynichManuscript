Some traits of the observable writing methods, while wholely shifted in perspective still remain largely in tact. The new data set retains these previously determined (HTTP://voynich.Nu/writing) traits:
(X) Written from left to right
Written from top to bottom
Written line-by-line
Written in short paragraphs
Text consisting of character groups separated by spaces

Inherintly other writing traits have now taken on different placement and would hypothetically be added as new data in the interpretation of writing contained within the manuscript prior to obscuring.

In addition to the traits presented in (Ill. 4), it now appears that the larger characters previously explored as the initial characters, have now become the (X) end of paragraph characters. From a graphic design perspective, it is evident from experimentation in duplicating the original that to avoid running out of space, and severely overlapping characters without a guide line becomes increasingly difficult and time consuming. Without any evidence of this guideline, it would in theory require the author to make very specific measurements in order to bring the text to follow an embellished character flush with the extremities as exhibited in the original scans. This limitation is lifted by the reverse engineering, as it now presents these characters being written in a way that avoids characters already present before and above each line, paragraph, and label. All the characters that originally rose above the imaginary median line now fall below the line, denoting that the character set is largely comparable to a "small" or "lower case" alphabet. It furthermore provides evidence that the manuscript has been written in a natural language, following logical stroke paths prior to tracing.
