Conclusion

 This paper should be considered an introduction to a new way of deciphering ms408. It is assumed that this research will reopen investigation into previously explored ideas and hypotheses that have long since been put to rest, and also open the doors to new methods and procedures.
 There has been an overwhelming amount of scientific rigor put forth and pitted against the mystery of MS408, and in many ways each and every method devised (regardless of outcome) provides valid and scientific research methods that could likely be applied to any literary analysis of old documents.
 Seeing the historical research background of the manuscript in combination with this paper, a person could collectively title a book as "What happens when you flip a document upside down and backwards..."
 While confident in the conviction of the proposed solution the author looks forward to seeing where this will lead, even if it is ultimately discounted and joins the multitude of failed solutions. Solutions that sound great to begin, but are ultimately met with limitations.
In any case, it is hoped that with the given evidence, the new data sets and new perspective, that it will provide researchers with a new and fresh avenue of exploration into the mystery of this magnificently constructed manuscript.
