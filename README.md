# The Voynich Manuscript / Solved

Here you will find my research on the Voynich Manuscript.

The decision to upload this information was a tough one but the truth i after struggling to find collaborators and being dismissed by other researchers so often its become a choice between letting it sit on my computer and letting it collect dust, or give it to the world. So rather than take this research to the grave, I've decided to make it public.

tbu
The translation bucket. A collection of translations from a few folios. There is a discrepancy that needs an expert, which is simply a spacing issue, as when you move the space which is hard to determine from the manuscript sometimes it changes the entire translation.
