# The Voynich Manuscript / Solved

Here you will find my research on the Voynich Manuscript.

The decision to upload this information was a tough one but the truth is that after struggling to find collaborators and being dismissed by other researchers so often its become a choice between letting it sit on my computer and letting it collect dust, or give it to the world. So rather than take this research to the grave, I've decided to make it public.

The research stems from a paper I previously published which can be found here : https://d6129ad4bb27bd465e98-58c191b98cc38e0752b7f97f6ccc733d.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/Vol13_43-55_Kunferman.pdf 

Folder Descriptions:

### cameraobscura
3d Models and photographs of the device used to encode the manuscript.

### diagrams
Diagrams of identified images with labeling. 

### font
A font of the alphabet and characters that were derived, some characters may need to be combined and refined for portions of the manuscript. Typesetting may be required but there should be enough glyphs to successfully recreate the entire manuscript if needed.

### notes
A few notes on the research, as well as some references to image sources, additional research, and other research.

### ocr
A semi prepped ocr template based on the font. My trial expired before I was able to run it, I was only able to get as far as inputting the font. Adjustments will need to be made to fine tune.

### scriptcomparison
The various images of handwritten period appropriate script examples that were used to identify the language.

### svg
Scalable vector graphics related to the research including entire upper and lower glyph sets seperated by the median line. Handwriting stroke patterns for characters.

### tbu
The translation bucket. A collection of translations from a few folios. There is a discrepancy that needs an expert, which is simply a spacing issue, as when you move the space which is hard to determine from the manuscript sometimes it changes the entire translation. Also the translator being used has been updated, so while the translations are still correct the characters may now transliterate to alternative phrasings.

# FAQ
## What is it about?
The manuscript appears to be a medical journal, or compendium of medical knowledge with illustrations of biological parts and systems. Most of the text contains religious overtones in combination the biological information.

## What Language is it in?
Through comparitive research and matching glyphs from handwritten samples on documents of the appropriate time period I've concluded the language is Old Church Slovanic. It is an old language that is the root of many languages including but not limited to Glagolitic, and modern Croatian. Of particular note is that the language is written from Right to Left, so for many translations it requires a transliteration.(see scriptcomparison)

## What are the plants?
After unobscuring the document, what is commonly known as plants in the manuscript are a variety of cells and biological systems. Of these include a Nueron and A motor neuron, correctly illustrated with various parts such as Synapses, Glial cells and the Nodes of Ranvier.(See diagrams folder)

## What are the "White Ladies"?
Upon examining the unobscured version of the manuscript I can safely say that the "White Ladies" appear to be sperm. The section containing them outlines the various components of the male reproductive system, and sperm production. An illustration of a male reproductive organ is present, which is labeled, and correctly shows the 2 tubules that seperate urine from ejaculation fluid. (See Diagrams)

## Why aren't I getting the same translations as you?
This would highly depend on the translator you're using. At the time of translations Google Translate was used, but has since been updated. Due to the nature of the language and the fact its so old it will be hard to pinpoint the exact transliteraion of the characters until an expert can analyze them. Some characters may differ in this transliteration. The best methodology for verification at this time is input the english found in the tbu folder to see what its current translation is, compare that translation to the tbu, make neccessary adjustments to the character transliteration. Example: "To dio" in modern Croation is "Ovaj dio".
