Here you will find my research on the Voynich Manuscript.

The decision to upload this information was a tough one but the truth i after struggling to find collaborators and being dismissed by other researchers so often its become a choice between letting it sit on my computer and letting it collect dust, or give it to the world. So rather than take this research to the grave, I've decided to make it public.

Folder Descriptions:

This folder contains the manuscript in black and white with high contrast, ready for an OCR to analyze. The manuscript has been unobscured to what would have been the original format. For more information on the process of encoding you can read my paper "The Voynich Manuscript: A New Perspective on a 600 Year Old Mystery" available in the peer-reviewed Rose-Croix Journal.
